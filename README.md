Once More with Feeling. Let's see how these branches work.

I am a student, recently fascinated with programming and diving head first into it.
I love puzzles, science, literature, theater, and learning new things. 
Studying Micro-Biology in the long run, I am taking a bit of a break to learn how to create apps/games/and generally how to create useable and interesting things involving established, new, and developing technologies.
After I become experienced in both realms, it is my goal to work in research and bring together Biology and Programming.

Star Trek is the best show, and nobody writes horror like HP lovecraft. I love German theater, and most novels, and spend a lot of my free time making things out of yarn.

Coffee is lifeblood.
